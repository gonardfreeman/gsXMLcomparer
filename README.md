# gsXMLcomparer
This is program for comaparing GrandSmeta ONLY xml files
It helps you to compare your objects(real not IT), and see where is difference in cost
About functionality:
In future I plan to campare it string to string, like what % of difference in new and old,
is there something was deleted/added in new and old.
For now it compare only "object" estimates.(20 05 2016 do not compare it, only print sum from my xml estimate;))
